# NET

Simple Networking for C++

# Building

Simple Networking is distributed only as a header. There is nothing to compile in this repository
other than tests which also illustrate how to use `net`.

## Dependencies

* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) 3.0.0 or newer
* C compiler. The following have been tested:
  * [llvm](http://llvm.org) 3.5 or newer
  * [gcc](http://gcc.gnu.org) 4.8.3 or newer
  * [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com)

## Instructions

I highly recommend building outside of the source tree so that build products do not pollute the
repository. The simplest way to accomplish this is to create a sub-directory named "build" as
follows:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

# Examples


# TODO List

# Contributing

1.  Fork it

3.  Commit changes (`git commit -am "Added new feature xyz"`)
4.  Push the branch (`git push origin new-feature`)
5.  Create a new pull request.
